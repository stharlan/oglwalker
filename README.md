# oglwalker
An exercise to build a simple opengl world to walk around.

From time to time I like to play with 3D graphics just to keep my memory fresh. This is a simple 3D first-person
walker using OpenGL. You can walk. You can see grid lines. That's about it - right now.

Why? Because I want to do it and it exercises the brain.
